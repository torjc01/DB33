**Decorations:**   

Military Cross  
La Croix militaire peut être décernée aux officiers de grades ne dépassant pas le grade effectif de capitaine (autrement dit, les majors à titre temporaire et par intérim y sont admissibles) ou aux adjudants, en reconnaissance de services distingués et méritoires au combat. En 1920, les conditions ont été modifiées afin de préciser clairement que la Croix devait reconnaître les services courageux et distingués en présence de l’ennemi, et que les officiers de la marine et de l’aviation pouvaient l’obtenir pour des services courageux et distingués au sol. - Anciens Combattants Canada.   
https://www.worldanvil.com/w/je-me-souviens/a/croix-militaire-item

Identifying the need to recognize junior commissioned officers and senior non-commissioned officers, the Military Cross was established on 28 December 1914 for commissioned officers of the substantive rank of Captain or below and for Warrant Officers. It was awarded for gallant and distinguished service in battle and recipients were entitled to the post-nominal letters MC.

Lt-Col C.A. Young Known as a Soldier and Sportsman 

Lt-Col C.A. Young of Quebec, who died recently at Toronto, spent the Second World War wit the Royal Rifles of Canda and commanded the last group of soldiers to surrender on the island. 

A veteran of both world wars, he was awarded the Military Cross for bravery in the Second World War. 

Well know in his youth as a sportsman, he became quite famous as a hockey player here. Among other sporting activities, he also excelled at curling. 

He was also a president of the Army, Navy and Airforce Association for many years. 

The 68-year-old army officer, who leaves many friends behind, was greatly admired by the men serving under his command. 

At the time of his sudden death, he was visiting his daughter, Mrs Harry Thompson, in Toronto. 

His father, the late Maj Alexander Young, was also a soldier and commanded the 52nd Battalion in the First World War.

## Email to Mrs Thompson, Jayne

Dear Mrs. Thompson, 

Greetings. Allow me to introduce myself. My name is Julio Cesar Torres, I live in Québec City, and I am a member of the Masonic lodge Albion #2. 

I suppose you know that your grandfather, Charles Alexander Young and your great-grandfather, Alexander Young, were both freemasons, and both members of Albion Lodge. 

Brother Alexander Young was in fact the Master of the Lodge for the year of 1913, shortly before deploying to the European theatre on First World War, where he would pay the ultimate sacrifice for his country. 

Our Lodge has its roots deeply into the military tradition: it was founded in 1752, as a military lodge attached to the 4th Battalion of the Royal Regiment of Artillery, British army; ever since, a large proportion of our members come from one of the three branches of the Forces. Today, almost half of our active brothers come from the military. 

To complement this beautiful relationship with the Forces, our lodge has a lasting tradition of over 100 years. Our November meeting every year is changed into a "Military Soirée" to remember and celebrate the service of our military in the defence of our country and our values. We also celebrate those who fell on battle and remember the sacrifice they have done so that we may have peace.  

This year I have the task of preparing a presentation about our Brother Charles Alexander Young, your grandfather. I am going to tell about his experience on First World War and about his hard experience as POW in WWII. Besides that, I am going to mention that your family has contributed greatly with the military: his father, his wife, his father-in-law, all have served the country... 

So, the reason why I am writing to you is that in my research I have found your gallery on "Thompson family tree" in ancestry.com, where you have some photos I would love to include in the presentation: Brother Charles' two photos, Brother Alexander's, your grandmother in a nurse's uniform. These are the images that would illustrate perfectly the words of praise that I will say on our "Military Soirée". 

I would like to request your permission to use these photos in my PowerPoint if you are comfortable with it. If not, there's no problem, I understand it and won't touch your photos. 

You may rest assured, the presentation will be private, it is going to be used on the "Soirée", only shown to our Masonic brothers. Of course, if you would like to see it, it will be my pleasure to share it with you. 

Thank you very much for your time, Mrs. Thompson. 

Sincerely yours, 

Julio Cesar Torres dos Santos
Québec, QC
