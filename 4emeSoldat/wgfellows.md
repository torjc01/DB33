**DEPARTURE OF A POPULAR OFFICER**

**MAJOR W. G. FELLOWS RETIRES FROM MILITIA AFTER 36 YEARS SERVICE**

After a service of thirty-six years in the Canadian Militia, Major William Grincell Fellows a well-known officer of District No. 5, Québec, has just retired on a well-merited pension, much to the regret of his many military and civilian friends, amongst all of whom he shared a great measure of popularity.

Major Fellows enlisted in the R.C.G.A. as a trumpeter and gradually worked his way through each grade of non-commissioned officer's rank until 1907, when after completing a long course at Woolwich, England, he successfully passed his examination, was promoted to commissioned rank, and appointed District officer in Quebec. In 1912 he was further promoted to the rank of Captain, and in December of last year he received his majority. He served in the North-West Rebellion in 1885, and his record in that campaign is as follows: Relief of Battleford (24th April); Action at Cut Knife Hill (2nd May); Operations against Chief Big Bear (june-July); Medal with clasp.

During his service with the Militia Major Fellows served ten years in Montreal as Instructor to the Montreal Garrison Artillery now known as Montreal Heavy Brigade, and in addition to his military duties drilled the Montreal Police Force. He had the distinction of being one of the Canadian Artillery team that in 1896 won the Queen's Cup, the only time that it had ever been won by an Artillery Unit outside of the British Isles. The team was under command of Lieut.-Col. Minden Cole.

He also organized and commanded the Field and Heavy Artillery from January to March, 1916, and so successful was his work that almost immediately after the arrival of the Battery in England it was sent to France. Last year, Major Fellows assisted Lieut.-Col. Martin, the well-known Railway Controller, in January, 1917, to organize the 257th Battalion Railway Battalion, to which he was appointed Adjutant, but owing to being unable to pass the Medical Board was himself unable to accompany the regiment to France, much to his disappointment.

Major Fellows has also figured in several of the catastrophes, which have from time to time overtaken Quebec, including the landslide and the St. Sauveur fire, in both of which the Artillery was called out to assist.

In fraternal societies, Major Fellows is also well-known. In the Masonic Order he has had the distinction of being Past-Master of the two oldest lodges in Canada, Antiquity No.1 of Montreal and Albion No.2, of Quebec, both of which are under the Grand Registry of Quebec. In addition he has been honoured by his brethren in the Order by being elected to the important position of District Grand Master of Quebec and Three Rivers. He is also a Past President of the Fraternal Club of this city. His popularity in these societies has been demonstrated by presentations he has received on various occasions from his fellow members, who esteemed him not only for his work as a member, but also for his genial manner.

The members of Major Fellows family have long been connected with the military. His father served in the Imperial Army and each of his brothers have had military service, all of them attaining to high rank. Two of his sons are on active service. Lieut. William Fellows, leaving here as corporal with the 2nd Battalion  C.E.F., which was then under the command of Major-General Watsca, by whom he was recommended for his commission. Another son Lieut. Harold Fellows is in the Royal Air Force and at the beginning of this month was reported missing, but there is now some grounds for believing that this was a mistake.
The many military and civilian friends of Major Fellows will wish him a long life and good health to enjoy a well-earned pension, and will also extend to Mrs. Fellows and family every happiness and good fortune in Montreal, where they have now taken up their residence.
