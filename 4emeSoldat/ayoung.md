It is the senior NCO of a Coy; it is a rank equivalent to warrant officer. He wears the rank insignia of a warrant officer 
(a royal crown) on all uniforms, except on No.1 Cerimonial Dress, on which a special rank badge is worn: three chevrons,

Regiments in 1813 during the Napoleonic Wars to reward long serving sergeants.

      UN QUEBECOIS TUE, UN AUTRE BLESSE 

      LA MAJOR YOUNG EST MORT AU CHAMP D'HONNEUR, LE LT-COL HAY EST BLESSE 

      (Dépêche spéciale à la PATRIE)

      QUEBEC, 8 - Sur la liste des pertes canadiennes publiées ce matin apparaît le nom d'un autre 
      officier Québecois tué au front: c'est celui du major A. Young. Le major Young était très 
      populaire dans le cercle de la milice à Québec: Il vint à Québec voilà plusieurs années 
      comme sergent-instructeur: il avait pris du service dans un régiment de Port-Arthur afin de 
      partir pour la guerre. C'est là qu'il fût promu major après avoir obtenu ses autres grades à 
      Québec: il a fait la campagne d'Afrique et a été décoré de la medaille du couronnement du Roi. 
      Il laisse une femme, un fils et une fille qui sont à Québec. 

      Quand il obtint sa commission de lieutenant dans la 5e brigade, il servait sous les ordres du 
      lientenant A. Hay, dont le nom ce matin apparait sur la liste de blessés. Ce dernier, au premier 
      camp de Valcartier était commandant en second du 2e batallion qui était alors commandé par le 
      général D. Watson.

**Obituary and notice to Albion's members to attend the memorial service of the late W Bro Alexander Young. Source: Quebec Chronicle, June 10th 1916.**

      Albion Lodge No. 2 
      A.F.& A.M.

      Members of Albion Lodge, No. 2, A.F. & A.M., are requested, and members of sister Lodges invited, 
      to attend Memorial Service for the late Earl Kitchener and the late Wor. Bro. Major Alexander Young, 
      52nd battalion, C.E.F., which will be held in the Methodist Church, on Sunday Evening, the 11th 
      instant, at 7 o'clock.
          By order, 
             C. H. KNOWLES, 
                Wor. Master.

**Circumstance of death:**    
as written in letters to the family by Major Young's brothers-in-arms who were eye witness of his death, his grand-daughter tells us of the circumstances of his death:

*"His men saw him go into a fox hole and then the explosion from the bomb that followed him in. It was very heavy fighting and by the time they could go back to look for him, there was nothing to be found."*

As his body could never be retrieved, there is no grave with his remains to be visited. The Commonwealth War Graves Commission has a [memorial](https://www.cwgc.org/find-records/find-war-dead/casualty-details/1597253/alexander-young/) for him at the [Menin Gate Memorial](https://www.cwgc.org/visit-us/find-cemeteries-memorials/cemetery-details/91800/ypres-menin-gate-memorial/), in Ypres, Belgium. 

However, in Mount Hermon Cemetery, Quebec City, there is a memorial to Major Young in his beloved wife's headstone, where his memory can be cherished near his home.
