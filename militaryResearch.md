**Search tips**  
- Some entries include only an initial for the given names. Try searching by surname only. Names can also be written different ways. The entries reflect the spelling of names as they appear in the files.
- If you do not find a relevant reference, try searching with only one given name instead of all given names.
- Try the * wildcard character, for example, Fran* for Frank, Francis, François.
- You can also search the `Canadian Virtual War Memorial` (https://www.veterans.gc.ca/eng/remembrance/memorials/canadian-virtual-war-memorial) to identify a service number or confirm a name.
- Army officers did not have service numbers. They were identified by their name and rank only.
- Only a small number of the database entries include place of birth and address at time of enlistment (locality, province, country). Abbreviations (http://www.icq.eps.harvard.edu/ICQpost.html) were used for Canadian provinces and territories and American states based on the ones used by the postal services.


**Canadian Virtual War Memorial**  
https://www.veterans.gc.ca/eng/remembrance/memorials/canadian-virtual-war-memorial  
The Canadian Virtual War Memorial (CVWM) is a registry to honour and remember the sacrifices of the more than 118,000 Canadians and Newfoundlanders who, since Confederation, have given their lives serving in uniform. The names of fallen soldiers found in the CVWM are inscribed in the seven Books of Remembrance.

The Canadian Virtual War Memorial also includes the Royal Canadian Mounted Police (RCMP)’s Honour Roll. The RCMP Honour Roll remembers those who lost their lives while performing operational police functions.
